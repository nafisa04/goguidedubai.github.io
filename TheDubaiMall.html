        <h1> The Dubai Mall</h1>

        <p>Located in the heart of the prestigious Downtown Dubai is The Dubai Mall,
           the world’s largest and most-visited retail and entertainment destination,
            which welcomes more than 80 million visitors annually. With a total
            internal floor area of 5.9 million sq ft, The Dubai Mall has 3.77 million
             sq ft of gross leasable space, over 1,300 retail outlets including two
              anchor department stores – Galeries Lafayette and Bloomingdale’s –
              and over 200 food and beverage outlets.
      The Dubai Mall offers an unparalleled retail mix combined with world-class
      dining, entertainment and leisure attractions. The Fashion Avenue, the precinct
       dedicated to high fashion now expanded, positions The Dubai Mall as the
       fashion capital for the Middle East. Another niche component is The Souk,
        an elegantly designed precinct featuring jewellery shops, accessory outlets,
        traditional Arab clothing and handicraft stores, among others. One of the
        mall’s unique precincts is an open-air streetscape, The Village that offers
         a rich collection of denim brands and brings an outdoor community feel
         with tree-lined walkways, cafés and restaurants.
